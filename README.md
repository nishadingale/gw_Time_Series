# Global Warming- Time Series Analysis and Data Visualization

#### This project is a part of the guided project at Coursera . Link of the orginal course and resources below.
https://coursera.org/share/50af5ad71b3de483904b59b08732960f

Tasks in the project:
Task1: Importing our dataset 
Task2: Data Preprocessing
Task3: Analysing global temperature from 1995 to 2019
Task4: Comparing yearly average temperature of different regions over time
Task5: Monthly average temperature in India
Task6: Monthly average temperature in Canada
Task7: Visualizing temeperature trend in the most affected and the least affected regions

In this Notebook I learned about different data visualization techniques for time series analysis.I completed different tasks  for a better understanding, exploration and anlysis, while working with time series datasets.
